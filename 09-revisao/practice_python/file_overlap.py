"""Exercise 23: File Overlap

Given two .txt files that have lists of numbers in them, find the
numbers that are overlapping. One .txt file has a list of all prime
numbers under 1000, and the other .txt file has a list of happy numbers
up to 1000.

(If you forgot, prime numbers are numbers that canâ€™t be divided by any
other number. And yes, happy numbers are a real thing in mathematics -
you can look it up on Wikipedia. The explanation is easier with an
example, which I will describe below.)
