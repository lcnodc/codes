"""Exercise 30: Pick Word

This exercise is Part 1 of 3 of the Hangman exercise series. The other
exercises are: Part 2 and Part 3.

In this exercise, the task is to write a function that picks a random
word from a list of words from the SOWPODS dictionary. Download this
file and save it in the same directory as your Python code. This file is
Peter Norvigâ€™s compilation of the dictionary of words used in
professional Scrabble tournaments. Each line in the file contains a
single word.

Hint: use the Python random library for picking a random word.
