"""Exercise 21: Write To A File

Take the code from the How To Decode A Website exercise (if you didnâ€™t
do it or just want to play with some different code, use the code from
the solution), and instead of printing the results to a screen, write
the results to a txt file. In your code, just make up a name for the
file you are saving to.

Extras:
    Ask the user to specify the name of the output file that will be
    saved.
