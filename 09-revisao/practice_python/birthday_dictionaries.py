"""Exercise 33: Birthday Dictionaries

This exercise is Part 1 of 4 of the birthday data exercise series. The
other exercises are: Part 2, Part 3, and Part 4.

For this exercise, we will keep track of when our friendâ€™s birthdays
are, and be able to find that information based on their name. Create a
dictionary (in your file) of names and birthdays. When you run your
program it should ask the user to enter a name, and return the birthday
of that person back to them. The interaction should look something like
this:

    >>> Welcome to the birthday dictionary. We know the birthdays of:
    Albert Einstein
    Benjamin Franklin
    Ada Lovelace
    >>> Who's birthday do you want to look up?
    Benjamin Franklin
    >>> Benjamin Franklin's birthday is 01/17/1706.
